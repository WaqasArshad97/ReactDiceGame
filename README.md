### How to Play Dice Game

The `Rules` component provides instructions on how to play the dice game. Here's a breakdown of the rules:

2. **Click on dice image**: Click on the dice image to roll the dice.

3. **Guess correctly**: If your selected number matches the dice number, you'll earn points equal to the dice number.

4. **Wrong guess penalty**: If your guess is incorrect, points will be deducted equal to the dice number.
